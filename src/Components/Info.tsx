              order to retrieve the model and being able to make the
              predictions. The model as of the last training has an accuracy of
              93%, not perfect but it can be better if it gets extensively
              trained in a larger dataset. Your uploaded images are kept on the
              server only for a few milliseconds and then they get deleted
              immediatelly after the model has finished. You can always contact
